        <h2>Joseph's Story</h2>
        <p>I was born on June,23,2024 and I currently go to Byrd Elementary. My first school was postma where I had Mrs.Fishers class. Then covid came and I went into into homeschool until 4th grade. While I was in third grade, I was signed up for cub scouts. It is real fun becuase we get to go on camping trips. When I was in 4th grade I had Mrs.Morris. In fifth grade I have Mr.Fredrick. My favirote candy is Sour Patch. My middle school is Anthony middlle schol , and my high school is Cy-springs. My favirote game is blooket.</p>
